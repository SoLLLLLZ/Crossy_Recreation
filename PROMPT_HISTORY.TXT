My strategy was to first create a comprehensive plan that I would feed into 
Claude. The plan was generated by Cursor and the main points I focused on was 
iterating a tech stack and splitting the project into stages that could be 
tested at each step. While working with AI, I’ve realized that AI is terrible 
at large tasks with many moving parts. On the other hand, it excels at small 
tasks. Therefore, I had Claude create each part one at a time and I ran the 
program at each stage to test and debug. This was also a change to integrate 
my vision into the project at each individual step. AI also needs very very 
specific instructions so having the comprehensive plan and tech stack from 
Cursor was super helpful. At that point it was easy to generate each step and test it.

Here is a list of prompts: 

##Instructions for Cursor to generate implementation plan##
I am creating a recreation of crossy road that I am vibe coding. 
Create an implementation plan that Claude can follow. I want to complete 
this project in 1 hour so make it feasible and look as close as possible to 
the real game in terms of UI. I can upload files later to add in character 
elements.  

Here are the requirements:
- Python
- Pygame 
- Provide the techstack 
- Provide different stages that Claude can build and test one at a time
- Provide super detailed instructions in each stage

Here are the requirements for the game
- As close as possible to real crossy road
- Close to 3D elements that resemble the real crossy road aesthetic
- Infinite scrolling
- Different types of terrain (train tracks, roads, water with logs)
- Coins
- Score tracking with different instances 
- Landing page with game instructions, and play button
- Pause button in the game that can go back to the landing page if desired
- Realistic physics with jumping and collision (character should be squished when hit)

##Instructions to Claude + Sent Claude the implementation plan from Cursor##
Hello, I am recreating crossy road in python using pygame. I will send you an 
implementation plan and want you to create each stage one at a time. 
First look at the overall implementation plan and let me know your thoughts. 

Files to reference: 
* Pygame documentation: https://www.pygame.org/docs/
* Crossy road overview: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossy_Road 
* I have attached images of crossy road:
* Chicken figure --> 1769890577453_image.png
* Landing page example --> 1769890631254_image.png
* Terrain with roads, grass, and cars --> 1769890652690_image.png
* Collection of assets --> 1769890698750_image.png 
* Arcitecture overview --> 1769890776874_image.png

##Prompts I sent at each stage##
Ok implement your feedback and start stage 1. Here is an example of a starting 
page but add your own flair to it

Good now implement stage 2

OK good However I would like to add my own chicken model in there. 
Explain how I do that here is a picture of my chicken model

Good. Now move onto stage 3

Good there are just a few bugs I want you to address
* You can't move backwards
* By infinite scrolling I did not mean that the background moves forward infinitely. 
I meant infinite terrain generation and the backgroun moves with the chicken so 
it doesn't move on its own

ok it works now do stage 5

OK that's good. Let's complete the game by adding the obstacles. 
There are still no cars, trains, or logs. And I want to make it so that the 
chicken can't spawn on the water and die instantly they need to spawn on grass



Notes:
- I like Claude the best for large coding tasks. I find that it generally 
performs the best and has a UI/UX that I prefer. It also generally performs 
the greatest on all the benchmark tests.
- Word choice is very important for AI. Initially I said I wanted infinite 
scrolling. The AI interpreted that as I wanted the screen to scroll endlessly 
(even if I wasn’t moving) instead of the intended output (infinite terrain 
generation). After I changed the word choice to infinite terrain generation 
it created exactly what I wanted.
- AI does well when you feed it pictures or concepts to base designs off of. 
Imputing pictures of crossy roads, the chicken, and assets of the cars/trains 
was useful.
- Telling AI to remember something is just as important as telling AI to do something. 
I had AI change the chicken model to something I prefered, but during it's next
implementation it forgot that I changed the chicken model. So I had to tell it to 
remember certain details that get carried over to following prompts.
